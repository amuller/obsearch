Synopsis:

Similarity search is required in many areas. For example, music matching and binary program matching require a similarity search engine. Nowadays, it is common to hear news of projects like "photosynth" that heavily rely on similarity search. OBSearch is a similarity search engine that can help you to create an interesting and new application!

Features:


  * Designed to handle efficiently heavy objects (trees, graphs).

  * Code generation for each primitive datatype (byte, short, int, long, float, double) for maximum performance.

  * The API is compact and easy to understand.

  * Stability and scalability: OBSearch's secondary storage backend is Oracle's Berkeley DB or Tokyo Cabinet. An extensive test suite makes sure that data integrity is preserved.

  * Cutting edge: We strive to put together the latest algorithms the similarity search community has to offer.

This project started as part of [Google Summer of Code 2007](http://code.google.com/soc/2007/). The mentoring organization was Portland State University.
